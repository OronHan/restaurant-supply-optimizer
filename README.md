# Restaurant Supply Optimizer – RL-Based Inventory Advisor

**Role:** Data Scientist  
**Duration:** 2024 – Present  

## 🧠 Overview

This project explores the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize supply decisions for restaurants, with the goal of minimizing throwaway while maintaining service quality.

We work with synthetic and anonymized data to simulate order behavior, ingredient shelf life, and customer group patterns. The system is currently in internal testing and has shown promising results in early simulation phases.

## 🔁 Project Features

- Uses RL to determine optimal daily order quantities for perishable goods.
- Incorporates multi-day forecasting based on known reservation and consumption trends.
- Simple data visualizations and dashboards make outputs interpretable by restaurant operators.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology (High Level)

- Environment simulates ingredient use across multiple customer groups.
- Agent receives feedback based on food waste and unmet demand.
- Policies are adapted to match fluctuating day-to-day consumption.
- Output includes item-by-item purchase recommendations and expected throwaway rates.

---

## 🧪 Current Status

- **Internal testing** phase using both realistic and synthetic restaurant data.
- Evaluation includes waste reduction rate, satisfaction score, and inventory stability.
- Preparing a pilot deployment for real-world restaurant feedback in Q3 2025.
